Program to calculate the closest pair of points in a set of points using divide and conquer in O(nlogn) time.
This homework took me 6 hours to complete.

Test Case Instructions:
We will use the brute force procedure we wrote in order to test our divide and conquer algorithm. Using the randomPointListGenerator() procedure, we generate sets of random points of 5 different sizes. We then calculate the closest pair using both the divide and conquer algorithm and the brute force method. We use assertTrue to compare the distances of our resulting pair from both these methods. The brute force method will trivially produce the correct result and if our algorithm produces the same result, then our algorithm is correct.
